## Welcome to Aegis 👋🏻

Aegis is a lightweight **note-taking app** that uses **Markdown** syntax to format your notes. The app also includes a **to-do list** for additional productivity needs.

You can create your first note by clicking on the top-left icon on the sidebar, or delete one by clicking on top right icon.

Following there's a quick overview of the currently supported Markdown syntax.
